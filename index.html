    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
I decided to join <a href="www.udacity.com">this course</a> because I want to learn how to write <b>code!</b> <br>
Currently I work with a team of <em>Chinese</em> developers for a company called <a href="www.intoomobile.com">INTOO</a>.<br>
<p><b>What did I learn so far?</b></p>
First of all of course the items Andy explained me to take away from the lesson:<br>
<b>1</b> What a web page is;<br>
<b>2</b> How coding works;<br>
<br>
Well I suppose you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
I actually started to make notes to remember some of the tags such as:<br>
<b>Bold</b>;<br>
<em>Italics</em>; and<br>
<a href="www.udacity.com">Links</a><br>
but one of the lessons was that programmers can't remember everything.<br>
<br>
The <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> session was a bit abstract but I am sure that will change soon.
<p><b>Conlusion</b></p>
Lots of fun so far, thank you!
